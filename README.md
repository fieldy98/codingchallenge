# codingchallenge
This is a coding challenge that requires an api backend and form on the frontend.


In this project I am using .NET 5 to build my API and React with Typescript to build my form. I chose to use an in memory database to remove the need of additional setup. To run the code navigate into the API directory and execute the command dotnet run. To launch the front end go to the web directory and launch with yarn start.
